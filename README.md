# Social Buzz Data Analytics and Visualization Project

## Client Information
- **Client Name**: Social Buzz
- **Client Industry**: Social media & content creation
- **Year Established**: 2010
- **Location of HQ**: San Francisco
- **Number of Employees**: 250

## Client Background
Social Buzz was founded by two former engineers from a large social media conglomerate, with one from London and the other from San Francisco. They founded Social Buzz in 2008 to create a platform where content takes center stage. The company emphasizes content by keeping all users anonymous and tracking user reactions on every piece of content. They have over 100 ways for users to react to content, going beyond traditional likes, dislikes, and comments. Over the past 5 years, Social Buzz has reached over 500 million active users each month.

## Project Overview
Social Buzz engaged us to help them with their rapid growth and data management challenges. They have a massive amount of unstructured data generated by over 100,000 daily posts, including text, images, videos, and GIFs. With 200 technical staff members out of a total of 250 employees, they required external expertise for three main reasons:
1. They plan to complete an IPO by the end of next year and need guidance.
2. They need assistance in managing their current scale more effectively.
3. They want to learn data best practices from larger corporations due to their substantial data challenges.

## Project Tasks Completed
In this project, I undertook the following tasks:
- Cleaned and prepared three datasets: Content, Reactions, and ReactionTypes.
- Merged the datasets to create a comprehensive dataset.
- Analyzed the content categories, highlighting the top 5 categories with the largest popularity.
- Created visualizations to represent the data.

## Data Analysis and Visualization
I analyzed the data and created visualizations to provide insights into the content categories and user reactions. Key visualizations include:
- Count of each unique content category.
- Count of user reactions on content.
- Month with the most posts.

## Project Results
- I analyzed their content categories and identified the top 5 categories with the largest popularity.
